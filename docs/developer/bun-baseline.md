# Bun Baseline

`bun-base` is the Bun foundation for `AtomiCloud/diene.bun-lib`. It is a
**sibling-template foundation**: sibling templates copy it and adapt a small set
of settings (see [Template maintenance](#template-maintenance)) before formal
CyanPrint template promotion.

Only Bun-specific baseline behavior is documented here. General standards stay
in `docs/developer/standard/`.

## Local commands

New Bun entries:

- `pls unit`, `pls unit:coverage`, `pls unit:watch`
- `pls int`, `pls int:coverage`, `pls int:watch`
- `pls test`, `pls test:coverage`, `pls test:watch`
- `pls build`
- `pls deadcode`

## Test modes

Two suites are split by Bun config so the fast path stays Docker-free:

- **Unit** (`bunfig.unit.toml`, root `tests/unit`) — pure `src/lib` behaviour.
  No containers; this is the default fast path.
- **Integration** (`bunfig.int.toml`, root `tests/integration`) — exercises the
  `src/adapters` boundary against a throwaway Redis container via Testcontainers.
  Slow and Docker-dependent, so it lives on a dedicated path.

The same `tasks/Taskfile.test.yaml` is imported twice from the root `Taskfile.yaml`
(parameterised by `MODE`/`CONFIG`) to produce the parallel `unit:*` and `int:*`
namespaces — there is one test recipe, not two.

Prettier owns formatting. Biome is lint-only. Biome and Knip are declared in
`package.json`, locked by `bun.lock`, and invoked from `./node_modules/.bin` in
pre-commit.

## Coverage gates

- Unit coverage: `coverage/unit/lcov.info`.
- Integration coverage: `coverage/int/lcov.info`. The integration suite excludes
  `src/index.ts` and `src/lib/**` (covered by the unit suite) via
  `coveragePathIgnorePatterns` in `bunfig.int.toml`.
- The local coverage artifact is blocking.
- Codecov upload is non-blocking and split by `unit` / `int` flags.
- `codecov.yml` thresholds are informational by default.

## Build & runtime

- Bun is the build toolchain (bundler, type emit, pack, publish) — there is no
  added node/npm runtime.
- `pls build` runs `scripts/local/build.sh`, which bundles `src/index.ts` into a
  dual **ESM + CJS** package plus flat type declarations:
  `dist/index.js` (`--format esm`), `dist/index.cjs` (`--format cjs`), and
  `dist/index.d.ts` / `dist/index.d.cts`. `ioredis` is kept external.
- `scripts/ci/build.sh` wraps that build with dependency setup; the package shape is
  validated separately by `scripts/ci/pkg-validate.sh` (`bun pm pack` → `publint` + `attw`).
  Only `dist` is published (`package.json` `files`).
- This sample is a **library**, not a runnable service — `src/index.ts` has no
  entrypoint; it re-exports the sample API (`buildSampleKey`, `createRedisStore`,
  `persistSample`) and its types (`IKeyValueStore`, `RedisConnection`).

## External service / compute cost

- Codecov upload runs only in CI and is best-effort.
- Integration tests require a Docker runtime (Testcontainers spins up a throwaway
  Redis); unit tests and the build do not.
- Unit, integration, build, and `package-validate` (`publint` + `attw`) are
  separate CI jobs.

## Template maintenance

`bun-base` is consumed by sibling templates before formal template promotion.
Keep CyanPrint-managed/shared scaffold edits additive. Settings a downstream
template is expected to adapt:

- **Package metadata** — `package.json` `name`/`description` (and the scoped
  publish name, the single source of the instance identity).
- **Coverage thresholds** — `codecov.yml` and any Bun thresholds added later.
- **Badges / template promotion** — the `AtomiCloud/diene.bun-lib` paths in
  `README.md` badges are rewritten on promotion.
- **Sample source/tests** — `src/lib`, `src/adapters`, `src/index.ts`, and the
  matching `tests/` suites are illustrative and replaced per service.

The secret task file (`tasks/Taskfile.secret.yaml`) is intentionally left
untouched by the Bun baseline — there is no direct Bun dependency on it.

Merge ownership stays manual: CI is driven to green, but the actual merge is a
human action.
